                Mrittika is a dedicated platform connecting rural terracotta artisans with global buyers.
                Many talented artists have the skill but lack the digital access to reach the wider market.
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '20px' }}>
                Our mission is to preserve the ancient art of terracotta while ensuring fair prices and
                recognition for the rural heartlands of our country.
